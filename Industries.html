Typically, manufacturers lose 8-10 days in transportation from the mother warehouses to the stores. With the average season for a fashion trend ranging from 3 to 4 months, it becomes crucial to deliver apparels from mother warehouses to the stores swiftly.

                                                    At Rivigo we have addressed this challenge through our unique tech-enabled model.

Reduced Transit Times: Through our unique driver relay model, we have been able to reduce the transit times by almost 70%. For example, we complete Bangalore to Guwahati trips in 3 days vis-à-vis an industry average of 9-10 days. We are hence able to add significant value to our customers by increasing the shelf life of their products by almost 7 days, thus increasing the availability and saleability of the apparels.

It is expected to be a USD 15-20 billion market in India by 2020. Auto OEM's have an unprecedented opportunity to scale up the aftermarket business. One of the biggest enabler of this growth would be to build a highly efficient and responsive supply chains. Most traditional and existing supply chains fail on several counts leading lower penetration of OEM aftermarket products. The spurious spare parts and low cost/quality alternatives continue to thrive.

However, with inflow of capital into the industry significantly reducing (from $2,156 mn in FY2014-15 to $391 mn in FY2015-162), ecommerce companies have started focusing on reducing cost and becoming profitable. Most important metric of success has changed from GMV (value of all goods sold on the platform) to profitability.<br />
                                                    <br />
                                                    Logistics cost (pickup, sorting, line haul and last mile) is the highest cost head at a shipment level, with line haul cost forming 50-60% of this total logistics cost in Indian ecommerce industry. One of the primary drivers of the line haul cost is the mode of transportation used i.e. air vs surface. In India, air was the preferred mode of transport for all line haul movements of more than 500 kms. This was primarily on account of poor service quality on surface: very long transit times and lower reliability.
